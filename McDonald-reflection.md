# Release 7: Reflect

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I struggled with commits prior to the GPS session, specifically making good commit messages. I asked about this concept during the GPS and received some helpful advice about being consistent with messages.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Our guide was able to clarify good commit messages.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I only asked about commit messages, but I asked my pair about her definition of the driver and navigator and we discussed the questions that were posed in the releases.

* What still confuses you about Git?
I think I'm still unfamiliar with GitHub workflow, but I think with practice and continued use it will start to make more sense to me.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Overall, I think it went well. I was nervous in the beginning because I wasn't sure what skill level my pair was at going into the GPS. I'm glad we talked about our backgrounds in the beginning as it gave me a sense of relief and comfort to make mistakes.
