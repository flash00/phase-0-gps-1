What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I struggled with getting comfortable with Git and GitHub workflows. So many commands, so many steps.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Taking the process from paper to action. Just going through the process with others clarified a lot.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I asked about the command "checkout." It was not intuitive to me until I thought about checking the branch out like a book from a library.
What still confuses you about Git? I still need to do the workflow process about 50 more times to form good habits. It's already easier having just done it a couple of times.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? The session went for over 3 hours because we were really exploring how to get to know each other and work with all the tools. It was a great experience but I was totally drained afterwards. There was so much going on and I felt like I was under pressure because others were relying on my participation. Also, the newness of working together over google hangouts was challenging. And you forget to take breaks. It will get easier as we get more practice.
